# Teachers Bot Improvement Plan

## Current State Analysis

The existing teachers-bot has basic functionality but suffers from poor user experience, limited features, and outdated interaction patterns. The robust teachers-api provides comprehensive backend capabilities that are underutilized.

### Current Pain Points
- Text-based commands requiring manual ID entry
- No teacher registration flow
- Basic error handling and recovery
- Missing financial management features
- No calendar/scheduling interface
- Limited navigation and menu structure

## 5 Key Improvement Tasks

    async def send_smart_reminder(self, lesson: Lesson, reminder_type: str):
        """Context-aware reminders with teacher preferences"""
        
    async def escalate_unconfirmed(self, lesson: Lesson):
        """Multi-level escalation for unconfirmed lessons"""
